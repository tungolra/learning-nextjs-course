# Learning Next.js Course

### About 
Advancing my knowledge on backend frameworks by learning Next.js. In this course, I've implemented JAMstack architecture within various Next programs, used dynamic routing, and understood the differences and use cases between Static site generation (SSG), Server-side rendering (SSR) and Static Page loads. I've also learned how to use styling through Next.js either globally or within custom components.
